# Onionprobe

![Onionprobe Logo](assets/logo.jpg "Onionprobe")

Onionprobe is a tool for testing and monitoring the status of
[Tor Onion Services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/).

It can run a single time or continuously to probe a set of onion services
endpoints and paths, optionally exporting to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

## Requirements

Onionprobe requires the following software:

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
* [Stem Tor Control library](https://stem.torproject.org)
* [Prometheus Python client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python)
* [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org)
* [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org)
* [PySocks](https://github.com/Anorov/PySocks)
* [Tor daemon](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor)

On [Debian](https://debian.org), they can be installed using

    sudo apt install python3 python3-prometheus-client \
                     python3-stem python3-cryptography \
                     python3-yaml python3-requests     \
                     python3-socks tor

## Installation

Just clone the repository

    git clone https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services/onionprobe
    cd onionprobe

## Usage

Right now Onionprobe works only with a configuration file.
A [sample config](configs/tor.yaml) is provided:

    ./onionprobe -c configs/tor.yaml

## Testing

Onionprobe comes with a working test environment with the [sample
configuration](configs/tor.yaml) and based on [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which can be started using

    docker-compose up

Then point your browser to:

* The built-in Prometheus dashboard: https://localhost:9090
* The built-in Onionprobe Prometheus exporter: https://localhost:9091

## Compiled configurations

Besides the [sample config](configs/tor.yaml) containing sites listed at
https://onion.torproject.org, Onionprobe comes also with other example configs:

1. [Real-World Onion Sites](https://github.com/alecmuffett/real-world-onion-sites) .onions at
   [real-world-onion-sites.yaml](configs/real-world-onion-sites.yaml), generated by the
   [real-world-onion-sites.py](modules/real-world-onion-sites.py) script.
2. [The SecureDrop API](https://securedrop.org/api/v1/directory/) .onions at
   [securedrop.yaml](configs/securedrop.yaml), generated by the
   [securedrop.py](modules/securedrop.py) script.

You can build your own configuration compiler by using the
[OnionprobeConfigCompiler](onionprobes/configs.py) class.
