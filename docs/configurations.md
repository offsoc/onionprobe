# Compiled configurations

Besides the [sample config](configs/tor.yaml) containing sites listed at
https://onion.torproject.org, Onionprobe comes also with other example configs:

0. [Official Tor Project Onion Service Sites](https://onion.torproject.org/onionbalancev3-services.yaml), generated by the [tpo.py](packages/tpo.py) script.
1. [Real-World Onion Sites](https://github.com/alecmuffett/real-world-onion-sites) .onions at
   [real-world-onion-sites.yaml](configs/real-world-onion-sites.yaml), generated by the
   [real-world-onion-sites.py](packages/real-world-onion-sites.py) script.
2. [The SecureDrop API](https://securedrop.org/api/v1/directory/) .onions at
   [securedrop.yaml](configs/securedrop.yaml), generated by the
   [securedrop.py](packages/securedrop.py) script.

You can build your own configuration compiler by using the
[OnionprobeConfigCompiler](packages/onionprobe/config.py) class.
